== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Where can I find the google analytics ID? =
Login to google analytics, go to the website profile which you want, edit and go to check status and there you see your google analytics code. You just want to copy your google analytics ID which will look like this UA-0000000-0 (but will be your own unique id.)

= Does it track logged in users? =
No, you wouldn't want to track logged in users because this would give you invalid results, everything else is tracked.

= What versions does it work on? =
It should work from 2.6 upwards.. Has been tested on all current versions and is working.
